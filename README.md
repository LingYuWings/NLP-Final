# NLP-Final
Final code backup
all things are in the simple-chatbot folder
It has GUI programmed based on PyQt library
## Dataset
data is saved in the json file, it is still need improve in this project. Since the dataset is small and using tensorflow instead of langchain, the chatbot's answer is not good as GPT models

## Performance
It can provide a daily conversation and make reactions to some simple questions, but can not do things that LLMs can do, it can only answer some spicific questions.
